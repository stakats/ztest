# Installation Instructions

### Where do I download Zotero?

You can download Zotero on the [Zotero download page](https://www.zotero.org/download/). Be sure to also install a Zotero Connector for your browser.

### How do I install Zotero? {#how_do_i_install_zotero}

#### Mac {#mac}

Open the .dmg you downloaded and drag Zotero to the Applications folder. You can then run Zotero from Spotlight, Launchpad, or the Applications folder and add it to your Dock like any other program.

#### Windows {#windows}

Run the setup program you downloaded.

#### Linux {#linux}

Linux users may wish to use a package for their distro rather than using the tarball directly. If you download the tarball, unzip it and run 'zotero' from that directory to start Zotero. Alternatively, on Ubuntu-based distros, move the directory to a location of your choice, run the bundled`set_launcher_icon`script to update the included “Zotero” desktop file with the full path to the bundled Zotero icon, and then double-click “Zotero” directly or symlink zotero.desktop to ~/.local/share/applications/ to add it to your launcher.

### How do I upgrade to a new version? {#how_do_i_upgrade_to_a_new_version}

Zotero should be updated automatically by default, or you can go to the Help menu and select “Check for Updates…” to check manually. You can also always manually install a new version of Zotero over your existing version without losing any data.

If you're currently running Zotero 4.0 for Firefox and wish to upgrade to Zotero 5.0, you'll need to install Zotero 5.0 from the [download page](https://www.zotero.org/download) along with the new Zotero Connector for Firefox. See [A Unified Zotero Experience](https://www.zotero.org/blog/a-unified-zotero-experience/) for more information.
